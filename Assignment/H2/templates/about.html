        I am a software engineer with a true passion for learning new technologies and applying them to
        create great software.
        Lately, I have been learning web development, using the frameworks that dominate the market.
        My goal is to keep learning new trends in technology and use them to develop hands-on projects and
        work with great
        teams with exciting people and professionals in the industry.
