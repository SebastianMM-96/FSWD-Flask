# Homework Assignment

In this folder you will find some of the tasks assigned during the course of the Full Stack Web Development with Flask course

## [Homework Assignment #1](https://github.com/SebastianMM-96/FSWD-Flask/tree/main/Assignment/H1)

Details:
 
Build a simple "hello world" application in Flask. Here are the specs:

1. The application should start an HTTP server that is listening on a port (any port is fine)
2. When you make a request to the base URL (no path), the application should return a 200 response, and a plain text body that says "Hello World"


## [Homework Assignment #2](https://github.com/SebastianMM-96/FSWD-Flask/tree/main/Assignment/H2)

Details:
 
1. Create a universal HTML structure template for your application.

2. Create a new route and template called /about, whose template inherits from the main structure. This route should respond to GET requests only, and it should always respond with 200.

3. On that /about page, create a title and a paragraph about yourself. Include any details that you'd like the world to know about you. The site you're building now will eventually be live on the web, and this will be your "About Us" page. If you'd rather make up a character (and keep your personal information private) go right ahead! We won't know the difference!

4. Add a profile picture (or your favorite avatar) on that page, and add a bit of CSS so the image is positioned next to the paragraph.


## [Homework Assignment #3](https://github.com/SebastianMM-96/FSWD-Flask/tree/main/Assignment/H3)

Assignment Details:


1. Make a list of all the individual routes and pages that will need to exist on your application. Now actually create those routes, and the empty HTML templates. Don't worry about filling in functionality yet, you are just creating the scaffolding of the application.

2. Choose the database you'd like to use for your app (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc). Whatever the choice, you'll want to install a working version of the database within your Ubuntu VM so your application can connect to it.

3. Design the database schema for your application. How many tables should exist? What columns should exist within those tables, and what should their data-types be? Once you've thought it out, now's the time to actually create those tables within the DB. Once you're done, export your schema / table-structure and that file in your application's folder.
