# Database and Model in Flask

In this folder you will find an approximation of how it is to implement a database model to a very simple Flask application.

The first thing to do is create the database schema. The next thing was to add data to the previously created database and finally a model was built to use the database.

This model is very simple, since we only obtain the favorite color of the users entered into the database.
