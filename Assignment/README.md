# Homework Assignment

In this folder you will find some of the tasks assigned during the course of the Full Stack Web Development with Flask course

## Homework Assignment #1

Details:
 
Build a simple "hello world" application in Flask. Here are the specs:

1. The application should start an HTTP server that is listening on a port (any port is fine)
2. When you make a request to the base URL (no path), the application should return a 200 response, and a plain text body that says "Hello World"


## Homework Assignment #2

Details:
 
1. Create a universal HTML structure template for your application.

2. Create a new route and template called /about, whose template inherits from the main structure. This route should respond to GET requests only, and it should always respond with 200.

3. On that /about page, create a title and a paragraph about yourself. Include any details that you'd like the world to know about you. The site you're building now will eventually be live on the web, and this will be your "About Us" page. If you'd rather make up a character (and keep your personal information private) go right ahead! We won't know the difference!

4. Add a profile picture (or your favorite avatar) on that page, and add a bit of CSS so the image is positioned next to the paragraph.
