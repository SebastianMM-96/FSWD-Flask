# Simple Hello World :wave:

Development of a simple application in Flask for the Hello World.
Here are the specs:

1. The application should start an HTTP server that is listening on a port (any port is fine)
2. When you make a request to the base URL (no path), the application should return a 200 response, and a plain text body that says "Hello World"
