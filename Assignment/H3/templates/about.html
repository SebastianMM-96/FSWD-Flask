                I am a software engineer with a true passion for learning new technologies and applying them to
                create great software.
                Lately, I have been learning web development, using the frameworks that dominate the market.
                My goal is to keep learning new trends in technology and use them to develop hands-on projects and
                work with great
                teams with exciting people and professionals in the industry.
